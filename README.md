# Test task

I added basic CRUD functionality pagination and sort for two fields.
I calls endpoints for CRUD by they mocked so delete operation didn't have influence on elements.
If I had more time I will extract Table in separate component, make pagination calculation a bit more clear and add support for other fields. 

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```
